## Motivation

Our goal was to create a site that was both useful and relevant, while still allowing us to push our knowledge bounds in javascript, react, and the deployment process. 

## Description

The Covid-19 Tracker allows users to view and track Covid related data and risk levels. The current version only has data for the United States. Data is displayed in both visual (line-graph) and raw (data table) formats.

## Tech

## How-To

The home page will display a table of data. Each row represents a US state. Data in row can be sorted or studied. Select a row to view graphical data for that state. If logged in, data table receieves an additional column with track buttons.  Tracked states can be viewed in the "My Tracked Locations Tab". Pandemic Resources and Information page renders a map of the United States. Select a state to be redirected to a webpage with relevant Covid-19 information for that state.
